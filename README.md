# Web Scraping - Mission to Mars

![mission_to_mars](Images/mission_to_mars.png)

In this project, I built a web application that scrapes various websites for data related to the Mission to Mars and displays the information in a single HTML page. The following outlines what I did.

## Step 1 - Scraping

Completed my initial scraping using Jupyter Notebook, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, and Requests/Splinter.

* Created a Jupyter Notebook file called `mission_to_mars.ipynb` and used this to complete all of my scraping and analysis tasks. The following outlines what I did to scrape.

### NASA Mars News

* Scraped the [Mars News Site](https://redplanetscience.com/) and collected the latest News Title and Paragraph Text. Assigned the text to variables that I could reference later.

```python
# Example:
news_title = "NASA's Next Mars Mission to Investigate Interior of Red Planet"

news_p = "Preparation of NASA's next spacecraft to Mars, InSight, has ramped up this summer, on course for launch next May from Vandenberg Air Force Base in central California -- the first interplanetary launch in history from America's West Coast."
```

### JPL Mars Space Images - Featured Image

* Visited the url for the Featured Space Image site [here](https://spaceimages-mars.com).

* Used splinter to navigate the site and find the image url for the current Featured Mars Image and assigned the url string to a variable called `featured_image_url`.

* Image url has the full size `.jpg` image and complete URL link to the image.

```python
# Example:
featured_image_url = 'https://spaceimages-mars.com/image/featured/mars2.jpg'
```

### Mars Facts

* Visited the Mars Facts webpage [here](https://galaxyfacts-mars.com) and used Pandas to scrape the table containing facts about the planet including Diameter, Mass, etc.

* Used Pandas to convert the data to a HTML table string, and saved the table string
  under templates/facts_tab_html.html.

### Mars Hemispheres

* Visited the astrogeology site [here](https://marshemispheres.com/) to obtain high resolution images for each of Mar's hemispheres.

* Saved both the image url string for the full resolution hemisphere image, and the Hemisphere title containing the hemisphere name. Used a Python dictionary to store the data using the keys `img_url` and `title`.

* Appended the dictionary with the image url string and the hemisphere title to a list. This list contains one dictionary for each hemisphere.

```python
# Example:
hemisphere_image_urls = [
    {"title": "Valles Marineris Hemisphere", "img_url": "..."},
    {"title": "Cerberus Hemisphere", "img_url": "..."},
    {"title": "Schiaparelli Hemisphere", "img_url": "..."},
    {"title": "Syrtis Major Hemisphere", "img_url": "..."},
]
```

## Step 2 - MongoDB and Flask Application

Used MongoDB with Flask templating to create a new HTML page that displays all of the information that was scraped from the URLs above.

* Started by converting my Jupyter notebook into a Python script called `scrape_mars.py` with a function called `scrape` that executes all of my scraping code from above and returns one Python dictionary containing all of the scraped data.

* Next, I created a route called `/scrape` that imports my `scrape_mars.py` script and calls my `scrape` function.

  * Return value is stored in Mongo as a Python dictionary.

* Created a root route `/` that queries my Mongo database and passes the mars data into an HTML template to display the data.

* Created a template HTML file called `index.html` that takes the mars data dictionary and displays all of the data in the appropriate HTML elements.

## Step 3 - Submission

To submit your work to BootCampSpot, create a new GitHub repository and upload the following:

1. The Jupyter Notebook containing the scraping code used.

2. Screenshots of your final application.

3. Submit the link to your new repository to BootCampSpot.

4. Ensure your repository has regular commits and a thorough README.md file

## Hints

* Use Splinter to navigate the sites when needed and BeautifulSoup to help find and parse out the necessary data.

* Use Pymongo for CRUD applications for your database. For this homework, you can simply overwrite the existing document each time the `/scrape` url is visited and new data is obtained.

* Use Bootstrap to structure your HTML template.
